    Payload name: WiFi Guppy
    Author: JustSomeTrout (Trout / troot.)
    Developed for Firmware version 1.0.4
    Category: Reconnaissance
    Wi-Fi channel congestion visualizer.
    Focuses on Wi-Fi channel load, not individual networks.

## Overview

**WiFi Guppy** is a lightweight reconnaissance payload that
provides a clear, visual snapshot of how busy each Wi-Fi channel is.

**WiFi Guppy answers the question**:

> *Which channels are crowded — and which ones are calm?*

The result is fast Wi-Fi situational awareness without digging through raw scan data.

</p>

## Features

- **Tri-band scanning**: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz
- Aggregates access point presence per channel
- **Grouped by band** for clear Wi-Fi situational awareness
- Visual bar-graph representation of channel congestion
- Color-coded output for quick interpretation:
    - 🟢 Low congestion (1-3 APs)
    - 🟡 Moderate congestion (4-7 APs)
    - 🔴 Heavy congestion (8+ APs)

## How It Works

1. Creates a temporary managed interface on phy1 (tri-band radio)
2. Performs an active scan using `iwinfo` (sends probe requests)
3. Parses band and channel information from scan results
4. Groups channels by frequency band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz)
5. Counts access points per channel
6. Displays relative channel load as a capped bar graph
7. Cleans up temporary interface on exit

The payload automatically handles interface creation and cleanup.

**Note:** This uses active scanning which transmits probe requests. It is not a passive/listen-only tool.

## Installation

1. Copy the `wifi_guppy` folder into:
   ```
   /root/payloads/user/reconnaissance/
   ```

2. The payload will appear in the Pager's payload menu under Reconnaissance.
